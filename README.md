# WaveNet  

This is an ever so slightly modified version of [A TensorFlow implementation of DeepMind's WaveNet paper](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet) to be run in Google Colab. You're probably better off with [the original repository](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet) (see for details & manual).

## Modifications

- 44.1 kHz sample rate and other default settings
